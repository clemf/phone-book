phone-book
==========

A web app that allow you to add contacts to a simple phone book. This was the week two assessment for Epicodus, testing my knowledge of object oriented design. Written in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) with the help of [RSpec](http://rspec.info/), [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/), and [Bootstrap](http://http://getbootstrap.com/). The data is stored in a PostgreSQL backend.

Usage
-----

Run [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) from the project directory to install all the gems phone-book depends on:

```ruby
bundle -install
```

Start the Sinatra server:

```ruby
ruby app.rb
```

In your browser, navigate to [http://localhost:4567/](http://localhost:4567/).
